Hello! This is the first incident report about our api! 

First we would like to say **thank you** to all who have used our api so far! If you have questions about on how to use our [‚Å†#üìò‚ïèbot-api‚Å†](https://discord.com/channels/639477525927690240/1192648696517640252) channel in our server.

On 01/12/2024 We have a new issue that has been brought to our attention, the python module `danbot-hosting` seems to not allow some people to install the python module and use it correctly. This has been brought to our attention and we will be looking into a way to fix this!
